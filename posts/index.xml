      <description>Say you&amp;rsquo;ve amended once to add a forgotten file, once to change the message, another one to remove a console.log, and you realise you are tired and you need to focus a little bit better.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll come up with a better description of what I did in my last commit right after I&amp;rsquo;ve committed it. Or maybe I forgot to appropriately prefix it or to append the branch name at the en of it.</description>

      <title>You need these git aliases</title>

      <description>Optimally we would always work in a purely linear way, after carefully planning all the code changes required to implement a certain feature. This works best if we are doing very small changes, modifying only a couple of characters or lines, if we are well acquainted with the codebase and the stack being used, or if we&amp;rsquo;re undertaking a trivial task that we can do almost mechanically.</description>

      <title>X-Powered-By: the price of vanity (22 bytes)</title>

      <description>Some web frameworks, most notably Express.js, automatically add the X-Powered-By header. The goal is probably marketing ‚Äîalthough we could call it recognition to the team that developed an a free and open source solution.</description>

      <title>X-Frame-Options: iframes are so 2005</title>

      <description>Back in the day iframes were used everywhere ‚Äîkeeping the URL the same while navigating, embedding Adobe Reader, even as a layouting tool ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äî but they can circumvent some CSP policies, are an accessibility nightmare and most notably they are the main medium of clickjacking attacks.</description>

      <title>Referrer-Policy: Whatever I&#39;ve been doing is non of your business</title>
      <link>https://guillem-gelabert.github.io/posts/referrer-policy/</link>

      <guid>https://guillem-gelabert.github.io/posts/referrer-policy/</guid>
      <description>The infamously misspelled Referer Header contains the address where the request originated, it is there for analytics, referrals etc. But as URLs can and do encode all sorts of information as Search Params or Path Variables it can open the door to tracking and leaking.</description>

      <title>X-Content-Type-Options: Don&#39;t sniff the mimetype</title>

      <description>With Content-Security-Policy you can avoid foreign scripts from being executed, but you can still inject malicious code as plaintext and let the browser figure out that it should be handled like code, defeating the whole purpose of CSP.</description>

      <title>Strict-Transport-Security: HTTPS and HTTPS only</title>
      <link>https://guillem-gelabert.github.io/posts/strict-transport-security/</link>

      <description>How many times did we, in the early days of internet, type http://www? Thanks to the browser&amp;rsquo;s integrated search and autocomplete this isn&amp;rsquo;t the case anymore, most of us just write my-bank.</description>

      <title>Content-Security-Policy: you&#39;re not on the guest list</title>
      <link>https://guillem-gelabert.github.io/posts/content-security-policy/</link>

      <description>Content-Security-Policy works like a guest list for resources, or more like a bouncer with highly specific acceptance criteria. It allows for very granular control on which origins should be allowed and for which cases: specifically for iframes, forms tags, images sources, fonts, XHR or WebSockets connections and plenty more (there are 14 directives).</description>

      <title>X-XSS-Protection: a security header gone wrong</title>
      <link>https://guillem-gelabert.github.io/posts/x-xss-protection/</link>

      <description>In 2010 Chrome shipped a new feature, XSS Auditor, that would prevent unsafe parts of the website to be rendered. Together with XSS Auditor a new HTTP Header was introduced, with which its behaviour could be controlled.</description>
